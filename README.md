# Reptile Planet
##### This project was created for two reasons. I wanted to put together my main interests. Coding and passion to animals, and to improve my skills with React Redux. The whole data is located in redux state, so it's very easy to manage it, from any part of the application. Items in basket are saved in local storage. When ordering, you can check the local weather conditions. I used OpenWeatherMap API for it. While browsing the store you may come across few pictures of my animals.

###  By going to subpages, you may notice some page flickering, it's beacause of scroll to top function.
