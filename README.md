# Reptile Planet
##### This project was created for two reasons - the desire to learn more about React Redux and the combination of my main interests. The website layout was designed by me in Figma. All product data and the shopping cart itself have been embedded in the Redux state. This way you can easily manage your data from anywhere in the application. When placing an order, you can check the current weather in the location specified by the user via the OpenWeatherMap API.

###  By going to subpages, you may notice some page flickering, it's beacause of scroll to top function.
