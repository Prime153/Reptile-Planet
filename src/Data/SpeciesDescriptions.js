  Accanthurus: {
    description:
      'Varanus acanthurus will measure 50cm to 70cm long. Half of their length is comprised out of the tail. This makes this species a very suitable alternative for the person who likes larger Varanus sp. but does not have the space or experience to keep their big cousins. The tail has sturdy rough scales like small spine, as described in their common name. This tail serves as a protection against predators when they rest between crevices in the rocks. In captivity these lizards are very active and not shy. They can get used to being handled but young animals will definitely have to get used to this and commonly don’t like to be handled.',
    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      ' They are active hunters and their foodresponce is high. They recognize tweezers and a box of food from a great distance. The major part of their diet consists of all kinds of insects and arthropods. In nature this species also feeds on smaller lizards like geckos and skinks. Young Varanus acanthurus may be fed every day with various types of insects, adult animals once every 2 to 3 days. You can sometimes offer a pinky mouse for calcium needs and regularly dust the feeder insects with a calcium and vitamin supplement. If you provide them with a proper UVB source additional vitamin D3 is not needed. Lots of insects can be fed like house crickets, steppe crickets, field crickets, banded crickets, various grasshoppers, superworms, mealworms, dola’s and Blabtica dubia etc.',
    Housing:
      'These animals are best kept in a spacious and fully decorated terrarium. A pair requires a terrarium of at least 120x80x60cm or 150x60x60cm. The bigger the better is certainly the case when it comes to these active lizards. V. a. acanthurus climbes the most of the two available subspecies, yet this lizard is mainly terrestrial and therefore requires a terrarium with a big floor surface. In very big enclosures one is able to accommodate a male with multiple females.',

  Phelsuma: {
    description:
      'Phelsuma species are often called Madagascan day geckos, and this name tells a lot about these lizards and what distinguishes them from many other geckos. That is that these gecko’s are diurnal, whilst most Gekkoidae are nocturnal. Over the They are diurnal geckos which mainly live against trees and in bamboo forests. During the evening they will hide against a smooth trunk, a hole in a tree or between leaves. There are species that reside on the trunk and relatively close to the bottom and species that live high in the treetops. Each with its own microclimate. They are territorial lizards that often do not tolerate others outside the mating season. The females can be also very intolerant towards each other. Males will always try to intimidate and chase another male and bite wounds as a result are not uncommon.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'The diet of these animals is very diverse. Naturally this not only consists of all kinds of small insects, but also nectar from various flowers and soft fruit. They need to get a lot of vitamins. It is therefore important you provide these animals with a varied diet. Feed 2 to 3 times per week insects. There are a variety of insects that are eaten greedily. Of course, the well-known crickets but sometimes little grasshoppers and waxworms and moths, woodlice and bean leaf beetles or dustcrickets and fruitflies for young animals. Flies (with curled wings) seem to be the big favourite when it comes to insects. Supplement the feeder insects with calcium powder without vit. D3. Also feed soft fruit two times per week.  You can also sometimes give babyfoods made of pureed fruits such as pear, mango and banana.',
    Housing:
      'House Phelsuma’s only per couple or separately. Most species are very territorial and housing several animals of the same sex together can lead to stress, oppression and fighting. Also combined with similar-looking lizards as Anoles is absolutely not recommended (not to mention that it can also come from an entirely different continent). This also applies to young day geckos. For an individual or couple of species to 10cm a minimum stay of 45x45x60cm is required. Species that get about 15cm require a terrarium of 60x45x60 and 60x45x90, the larger species such as P. standingi and P. madagascariensis require a minimum sized enclosure of 60x45x90cm per couple. Remember these are minimum sizes, if you can offer more space this will be surely appreciated by the active lizards.',

  Eublepharis: {
    description:
      'Leopard geckos are nocturnal reptiles; during the day they retreat to burrows and sheltered hiding spots, becoming active at dusk when the temperature is favorable. Winter temperatures within the range of the leopard gecko can be quite low, below 10 C, forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called brumation, living on fat reserves. Leopard geckos are small lizards that derive their name from their spotted coloration. Hatchlings are on average 7 to in length and weigh about 2 to 5 grams. Adult females are about 18 to in length and weigh about 50 to 70 grams, while adult male geckos are about 20 to in length and weigh about 60 to 80 grams. Unlike many other geckos, but like other Eublepharids, their toes do not have adhesive lamellae, so they cannot climb smooth vertical walls.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'In the wild leopard geckos are insectivores, eating just about anything that moves in front of them. They do not and will not eat plants or vegetables, so don’t even offer them. Most pet leopard geckos will not eat dead insects, so make sure you have a good live-food source nailed down before you bring your pet leopard gecko home. Feed them late in the day or early in the evening to mimic their natural feeding times, but know that every gecko has different eating habits so there is no one ideal routine to follow. Dust the non-breeding adult’s diet with a calcium carbonate or calcium gluconate supplement once weekly, more often if the gecko is actively breeding. Calcium supplements should be devoid or low in phosphorus with a minimum Ca:P ratio of 2:1. A general vitamin/mineral supplement may also be offered once weekly.',
    Housing:
      'Leopard geckos are terrestrial in nature. So you will want an enclosure that has more ground space than height. Adults can live in a 20 long enclosure or an Exo Terra 18" x 18" x 12". That size can comfortably house 1-3 adult leopard geckos for their whole life. Groups of one male and two females or all females work well. If you have more than one adult male, they will fight. Keep them in separate cages. Its also important that your leopard geckos are of similar sizes. Dont house a baby with an adult. If one is significantly larger than the other, the smaller one usually ends up being bullied by the bigger.',

  Ciliatus: {
    description:
      'The crested gecko or eyelash gecko is a species of gecko native to southern New Caledonia. They do not have eyelids. Instead, a transparent scale, or spectacle, keeps each eye moist, and the geckos use their tongues to clear away debris. Like the closely related Rhacodactylus geckos, crested geckos have webbed legs and digits. They are a mostly arboreal species, preferring to inhabit the canopy of the New Caledonian rainforests, and because of this they can jump considerably well. They are primarily nocturnal, and will generally spend the daylight hours sleeping in secure spots in high branches. Crested geckos are, however, less strong climbers than tokay gecko.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      ' Crested geckos are omnivores and thrive on commercially produced powdered diets. Here at Lick Your Eyeballs, we use Pangea as their main food source alternating between flavors. We supplement with occasional pureed tropical fruits that are high in calcium such as papaya, figs and berries. Insects such as crickets and dubia roaches are offered a few times a month to promote physical activity and as a protein source. Dont leave extra insects roaming the cage - they often chew on uninterested reptiles. Hatchlings should be fed daily to every other day. Adults can be fed every other day.  All fruit puree and insects should be dusted with a 50/50 mix of calcium and vitamins. ',
    Housing:
      'Above all, the terrarium should be spacious and tall. It is recommended to keep young animals separately, so that there is no food competition, clashes between young males, mating too young females and in order to be able to more control the amount of food consumed by a given individual. For young geckos (up to 4 months of age) terrariums of 20-40 liters are recommended, for a single adult specimen an 80 liter terrarium (e.g. 40x40x50 cm) is sufficient. We usually keep adult individuals together, remembering not to keep 2 males in one terrarium, because they will fight each other regularly, which can result in very serious injuries',

  Auriculatus: {
    description:
      'Rhacodactylus auriculatus, or Gargoyle Geckos, are a robust arboreal species native to the Island of New Caledonia. These geckos have a portly build, semi-prehensile tail, and two distinct knob-like structures or “horns” atop their heads that give them their name. They are currently classified in the genus Rhacodactylus along with other geckos that you may know, including crested geckos (Rhacodactylus ciliatus) and giant geckos (Rhacodactylus leachianus). Auriculatus, or “aurics” or “gargs” for short, have been in the hobby longer than either ciliatus or leachies, but did not truly gain popularity until the crested gecko phenomenon caught on. In relationship to cresteds, gargs have a similar diet, similar habitat and similar care requirements so they are a natural choice for someone looking to get their second or third gecko if they are already keeping cresteds.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'Gargoyle geckos are insectivorous and frugivorous, meaning they eat both insects and fruits/nectars in the wild. They also have been known to eat young birds and other reptiles, so housing them with other species or even other gargs of a different size is not recommended. Food can be in the form of insects, powdered meal replacements or home made fruit purees and should be offered at least 3 times per week. Suitable insect prey can include crickets, roaches, and various worms – all appropriately sized, of course. Powdered meal replacements such as Repashy’s CGD (crested gecko diet) or Clark’s FGD (frugivorous gecko diet) are easy to use and well liked by these geckos. No matter what you are feeding them, make sure you are using a high quality vitamin and mineral supplement, such as Sticky Tongue Farm’s Miner-All and Vit-All, at least every third feeding.',
    Housing:
      'Auriculatus are arboreal geckos that inhabit the lower portion of the forest and spend more time at floor level than their other Rhacodactylus relatives. This should be taken into consideration when setting up a vivarium for them. I have found that my gargs tend to like more length and width in their terraria than height. I’m not saying that height is not important, as these are technically arboreal geckos, but that while you might choose an 18”x18”x24” tank for a crested gecko, for a garg a wiser choice might be an 18”x24”x18” tank. Minimum tank size for 1 adult is 10 gallons, but 20 gallons or larger is preferred.',

  Chlamydosaurus: {
    description:
      'Chlamydosaurus kingii is one of Australias most distinctive and familiar dragon lizards. It is a large lizard, averaging 85 cm (33 inches) in length. C. kingii is moderately robust with long limbs and a moderately long tail. The general coloring of this lizard is grey-brown. The tail is obscurely striped with a dark grey tip. The tongue and mouth lining are pink or yellow. But its most distinguishable feature is the large Elizabethan-like ruff or frill that it raises abruptly around its neck when it becomes alarmed. The neck frill is simply a thin but extensive fold of skin surrounding the throat, which when fully erected may measure almost 12 inches across. The frill lies like a cape over its shoulders until erected.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'Under natural conditions, collar agams eat a variety of insects (including grasshoppers, cicadas) and spiders. Agams hunt mainly in the morning (around 9.00 am) and in the afternoon (around 5.00 pm). Usually they sit on bushes or trees at a height of 2-3 meters and observe the ground surface. When the victim appears, they quickly descend and run on two limbs, and after catching it and eating it, they climb up the next tree. The favorite food of collar agams are ants, which are caught by lizards along their paths and in their nests. There are also reports of agams selecting eggs from bird nests. Vitamin and calcium supplementation is necessary, especially in young animals. The preparations used include preparations used in reptiles, such as Sera reptilin (also contains calcium) or Tetra ReptoSol (no calcium in the composition), preparations for birds, eg Pantosal New (in appropriate dilution, contains lime).  ',
    Housing:
      'Frilied dragons require spacious, tall and properly equipped terrariums. There are different views on how this species is reared. Some breeders prefer to keep single collar agams and pair them only for a few months during the breeding season. Others believe that pair breeding is best, and others even allow two males and several females to be kept together. For one individual or an adult pair, it is recommended, according to various sources, to have a terrarium with dimensions of 130 x 100 x 220 (length x width x height), 160 x 100 x 250 or 200 x 80 x 130 cm. In some cases, breeders keep 2 males and 7 females in the 200x200x300 cm terrarium. For young, the terrarium should be smaller (e.g. 100x50x150 cm). Generally, the bigger the terrarium, the better.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'They feed on insects and their larvae, as well as fruits and leaves. The diet of these lizards is hassle-free as they eat almost anything. It gives the possibility to offer a varied menu. Locusts, spiders, house crickets, and fruit and flowers. Liquidation, as with many skinks, from time to time you can give a fruit puree.',
    Housing:
      'The terrarium should be desert, very well lit terrarium with a thick layer of sand. The side walls should be finished with eg cork, rocks or mortar in order to increase the "usable" area for lizards. The rest of the decor should be used with stones and rock slates of various sizes.',

      'They are colourful, attractive and easy to handle. If you want to start with reptiles as pets, the veiled chameleon is ideal for you. They are not that suitable for kids because they need their privacy and they don’t like being petted. Yemen chameleons are hardy, striking-looking lizards with a tall casque (helmet-like structure) on the top of the head. The casque is present on both males and females, and helps to steer water that falls onto their heads into their mouths. Veiled chameleons have bodies that are coloured in shades of green, yellow and brown. They are able to change according to the surrounding area and their mood. They can live approximately 6 to 8 years in captivity.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'The main part of the chameleon’s diet comprises insects – usually crickets, grasshoppers or locusts. Some chameleons also eat flour worms. It’s also recommended to provide your little green friend with fresh fruit, e.g. lettuce. With feeding comes one of your most important duties – the providing of additional vitamins and nutrients. You need to provide additional calcium for good growth of the bones and to prevent rickets, which is the most common problem. You can buy calcium and vitamin powder in your pet shop or at the vet’s and simply sprinkle it on the crickets. Also, it’s important to use a water dispenser, so the chameleon can get hydrated. Again, heavy foliage and a lot of flowers are important, as they are helpful for the chameleon.',
    Housing:
      'Terrariums for chameleons are individual, and it doesn’t matter if they are bought or homemade. Chameleons are arboreal, which means that they live in trees, so you have to simulate these conditions. A chameleon’s terrarium is usually high and narrow. Chameleons need a lot of flower and sticks, so that they can climb and hide. It’s advisable to put in enough sticks to make a maze for the animal to climb on, allowing it to move freely across the terrarium. Also, it’s important to have proper soil at the bottom of the terrarium. Sand is not recommended; it is better to use mulched husk. Another important thing for the chameleon is airflow. The terrarium should “breathe”, to avoid concentration of moisture and consequently moulding. When placing the terrarium in a room, bear in mind that it shouldn’t be placed in a draught, for the sake of the reptile’s health. A light, quiet place is recommended for the terrarium. ',

      'Named after its relative size in the group of girdled lizards. It is the biggest species in the group. The genus, Smaug, is named after the legendary dragon of the same name in the novel ‘The Hobbit’ by J.R.R. Tolkien. Smaug giganteus, formerly known as Cordylus giganteus, is the largest lizard in the girdled lizard group. Adults are average 22 cm long. The longest recorded sungazer was measured close to 40 cm long. The tail is covered by thick, large, spiny scales decreasing in size from the base to the tip. Smaug giganteus, like other girdled lizards, use various methods for protection. The spiny scales covering their bodies act as protective armour against predators',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'Dietary specifications for this species are considerably diversified. The chef nutrition comprises of all style of insects, from grasshoppers and crickets to bugs and mantids. They will likewise demand herb stuff, such as shrubs, dropped berry, and bulb caps. Provided the opportunity, and if they can reach them, they will further consume tiny reptiles. Except some sources give specifying of it, young mice will likewise be considered.  When having these species in confinement, greatly of their nutrition is readily sufficed.  Roughly 20 sole ages before, there was surprisingly small in the form of insects to support confined reptiles, but some experts worked to take roaches, locusts, and other local bugs to supplement some modification to their essential intake of mealworms.',
    Housing:
      'Sungazers require a spacious horizontal terrarium. These lizards do not climb very well, therefore the height of the terrarium and the presence of a structural wall are of little importance. For a couple, the minimum terrarium dimensions are: 200 cm x 100 cm x 60 cm (length x width x height). The bottom area must not be less than 2 square meters. Some, however, suggest smaller dimensions of the terrarium, referring to the "binding" of the lizard to the entrance to the hideout, which is related to its low activity. The temperature in the terrarium during the day should be 22-28 ° C, and 40-45 ° C under the radiant heat. At night, the overall temperature should be lower, reaching 17-20 ° C. The humidity in the terrarium should be maintained at 50-60%. We light the terrarium 12-14 hours a day.',

The limbs are well-defined and uniformly developed. The head is large and set off from the neck, and they have large, prominent eyes with vertically-slit pupils. The eyelids of these animals are fused together and transparent. They also have remains of a rudimentary third eye on the top of their head, which is believed to coordinate their activity to light conditions. The Tokay gecko gets its name from the characteristic sounds (To-kay) that they produce. Despite the low price of wild-caught animals we do not recommend these geckos for beginners.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'This gecko is a good hunter and eats all almost everything that fits in its mouth. So feed a varied diet. Young animals can feed on small crickets, grasshoppers, Isopods, waxworms and moths, dubias and mealworms. Adult animals have the same diet only bigger including large grasshoppers, crickets and field or steppe crickets, mealworms and zoophobas. Dust the insects is at least 2x per week with a calcium powder supplement containing vitamin D3. To give egg-laying females extra calcium you can use pinkie mice. Do not use these as a staple diet but as an addition on an already varied diet. Feed young tokay 5x a week, adult animals can be fed on average three times a week. Feed if needed egg producing females a bit more.',
    Housing:
      'The minimum size terrarium for a single animal is 60x45x60 and 60x45x90 for a couple. House these geckos only apart or per couple (1.1).

Its color ranges from various shades of browns, grays, and black with patterns ranging from transverse striping, white side-banding with black spots, or overall white blotching. These geckos have a large head, thick body and a short tail that is comprised of two distinct segments: a broad base and a short slender section, separated by a fold of skin.

Offer this in a sturdy, shallow crock that cannot be easily tipped over. Remove uneaten food after 24 to 36 hours. This can be done two to three times a week.  Fruit puree can also be offered, but you must supplement it before feeding. To add variety, also offer crickets (sized according to the distance from the gecko’s eye to its mouth), waxworms or Dubia roaches several times a week.',
    Housing:
      'A minimum size of 60cm x 60cm x 60cm is recommended for an adult pair. Never house males together as they will fight and can inflict serous injuries. If a number of animals are to be housed together make sure they are of a similar size and always closely monitor after first introductions. Peat or coconut fibre substrate can be used for juveniles/adults. Hatchlings are best kept on kitchen roll. Being an arboreal species, climbing branches and cork bark should be used, also provide a different hide spot for every occupant. Plenty of foliage either real or artificial should also be used. A hide box half filled with a mixture of moistened vermiculite or perlite, peat and sphagnum moss should be included to facilitate shedding and egg laying if a natural substrate is not used. Any fecal matter should be removed immediately with a complete cleaning occurring every month.',

It is extremely important not to overfeed them, so feeding adults should not be more than once a month. We feed young animals every 2 weeks with food of appropriate size. It is important that the size of the food is appropriate to the size of the python, i.e. after a meal, the husband should have a distinct thickening in the middle of his body. These pythons are adapted to swallow prey twice the size of their heads.',

Juvenile green tree pythons are typically yellow, red or dark brown-black. As they mature, their color changes to the bright green many adults display. Some individuals keep their bright-yellow juvenile colors, and some turn straight to blue. Each color is unique and stunning in its own way. Watching the color change is one of the most exciting things about owning these beautiful snakes.',

    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'In nature, they hunt birds and small mammals. Juveniles also eat lizards. Their efficiency reaches such a level that they can catch a bird or a bat that is just flying past them. In terrarium breeding, they eat mice, medium rats, but birds are their delicacy anyway - sparrows, day-old chicks, quails. We usually feed them at dusk. We can give them dead food, freshly whipped or thawed and warmed up. Providing live food is combined with observation whether the snake has caught the food animal and ate it, and whether it was harmed by strangling the victim. Giving a dead victim relieves us of such careful observation. We feed the adult animals every 10-14 days, and only with one food animal, because due to their low metabolism and low mobility, they are easily fat, which negatively affects their condition.',
    Housing:
      'Due to the arboreal lifestyle and natural biotope, these snakes are bred in a moist vertical terrarium, so that the conditions resemble those of a tropical forest. Due to the high humidity in the terrarium, rooms made entirely of glass or plexiglass are recommended, as metal or wooden elements quickly deteriorate from excessive moisture. For an adult couple, the minimum dimensions are 70/70/120 cm. We keep young snakes in smaller terrariums, but remember that the height should be its largest size because these snakes usually occupy positions at the highest point of the terrarium.',

Anacondas are extremely heavy and can grow to almost 30 feet in length.  They are the second longest snake in the world and only the reticulated python is longer.  Baby anacondas are usually 20-34 inches in length when they hatch and grow very quickly. Green anaconda coloration is characteristically dark olive-green dorsally, gradually changing to yellow ventrally. They have round dorsal blotches that are brown with diffused black borders, and are dispersed over the mid to posterior length of their body.',
    FeedingAndSupplementation:
      'Anacondas feed on fuzzy or small adult mice as babies and juveniles.  As your snake grows it will soon move up to rats, rabbits, or even small pigs.  We recommend that you feed baby and juvenile anacondas 1-2 times per week.  Adults can be fed once every 7-10 days to maintain proper body weight.  Like most snakes, anacondas typically will not eat when they are preparing to shed.  After your snake has shed you can return to your normal feeding regiment.  If your snake doesn’t eat make sure you remove the rodent from the cage.  Rodents, when they are hungry, can bite snakes and can injure or kill them.  A large water bowl should be provided at all times and the snake should be able to completely submerge itself. ',
    Housing:
      'Wet type mimicking a tropical forest floor. As a substrate, it is best to use coconut fiber (lignocel) or de-acidified peat, but you can also use sawdust, newspapers and other materials.

It will facilitate water exchange, which will be a lot for these hoses. We keep large specimens in tanks with minimum dimensions of 180x90x50 cm or financing built on our own for males and 150x70x50 cm for males. Most adults can comfortably be kept in tanks measuring 250 x 100 x 60 cm.',

This is now known to be untrue, but the name is still used to describe this beautiful snake. Milk snakes have beautiful tri-banded colourings of either red, black and yellow or white, black and red. They seem to have evolved to mimic the colourings of the deadly Coral snake, which many believe is as a defensive measure to scare off predators.
